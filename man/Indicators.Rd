\title{Monetary Laeken Indicators under the GB2
}
\description{
Functions to calculate four primary social welfare indicators under the GB2, i.e. the at-risk-of-poverty threshold,
 the at-risk-of-poverty rate, the relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap, and the income quintile share ratio.

\details{
In June 2006, the  Social Protection Committee, which is a group of officials of the European Commisiion, adopts a set of common indicators for the social protection and social inclusion process.
It consists of a portfolio of 14 overarching indicators (+11 context indicators) meant to reflect the overarching objectives (a) "social cohesion" and (b) "interaction with the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (launched in 2000) objectives";
and of three strand portfolios for social inclusion, pensions, and health and long-term care.

The at-risk-of-poverty threshold (or ARPT) is defined as 60\% of the median national equivalized income. 

The at-risk-of-poverty rate (or ARPR) is defined as the share of persons with an equivalised disposable income below the ARPT.

The relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap (or RMPG) is defined as the difference between the median equivalised income of persons
below the ARPT and the ARPT itself, expressed as a percentage of the ARPT.

The income quintile share ratio (or QSR) is defined as the ratio of total income received by the 20\% of the country's
population with the highest income (top quintile) to that received by the 20\% of the country's population with the lowest
income (lowest quintile).

Let \eqn{x_{0.5}}{x_0.5} be the median of a GB2 with parameters \code{shape1} \eqn{= a}, \code{scale} \eqn{= b},  \code{shape2} \eqn{= p} and \code{shape3} \eqn{= q}. Then, 
\deqn{ARPT(a,b,p,q)=0.6 x_{0.5}}{ARPT(a,b,p,q)=0.6 x_0.5.}

The ARPR being scale-free, \eqn{b} can be chosen arbitrarily and can be fixed to 1.

The QSR is calculated with the help of the incomplete moments of order 1.

\code{main.gb2} and \code{main2.gb2} return a vector containing the following set of GB2 indicators: the median, the mean, the ARPR, the RMPG, the QSR and the Gini coefficient.  
The only difference is in the input parameters.
}
\value{
\code{arpt.gb2} gives the ARPT, \code{arpr.gb2} the ARPR, \code{rmpg.gb2} the RMPG, and \code{qsr.gb2}
calculates the QSR. \code{main.gb2} returns a vector containing the median of the distribution, the mean of the distribution, the ARPR, the RMPG, the QSR and the Gini coefficient. 
\code{main2.gb2} produces the same output as \code{main.gb2}.
